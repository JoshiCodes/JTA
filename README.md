# JTA (Java Telegram API)
###### (Name inspired from the Discord JDA)

This Project is a try in creating a complete Telegram API for Java.
I do not plan to have it work as well as some others, rather as a learning experience for me.

If you need a full Telegram API for Java, have a look at [this](https://github.com/pengrad/java-telegram-bot-api).

## This API is not finished and may not be finished in the future.
